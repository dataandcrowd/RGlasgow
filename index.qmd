#### Geostatistical Modelling {style="color: orange;"}

-   Statistical properties of the observations (e.g. Kriging)
-   Pros: Mathematically sound concept, quick implementation speed, easy data aggregation, and useful software
-   Cons: Artefacts, Not fully addressing small-scale variation, smoothed (no emission)

#### Atmospheric Modelling {style="color: green;"}

-   Mathematical assumptions to measure the impact of emission of atmosphere (e.g. CALPUFF)
-   Pros: Consider Meteorological Impact

#### Given we have a temporally rich but spatially poor pollution data, why don't we start from a computationally light, reproducible, and mathematically sound model? {style="color: CornflowerBlue;"}

## Objective

To develop an air pollution package in R that allows anyone to easily generate a pollution map

* To examine small-scale variations that occur during SI prediction
* To introduce a new road-scale spatial interpolation method that employs road weighting

# Method

## From Points to Areas 
* How are we going to create an air pollution field, given a set of points?
* What is the distribution of air pollution?
* How does the air quality in one station relate to the other ones?

::: {.fragment}
For example, the air quality one meter ahead of you is more likely to be similar than 100 meters away.

Spatial Autocorrelation: "**Closer things** are more predictable and have less variability. While **distant things** are less predictable and are less related".

## Modelling with Universal Kriging {.scrollable}
* How do we create a systematic map? => build a *semivariogram*

![](images/study-points-specific.png)

<!--Considering Small-scale Variability is needed =\> build a *semivariogram*-->

* To build a semivariogram, always remember we are looking at **all distances** between 2 samples and their **variability**

## Modelling with Universal Kriging 

Since NO~2~ varies substantially between nearby stations, it might be difficult to get a perfect empirical semivariogram.

["AutoKrige"]{style="color:red;"} in the `automap` package might help us find near to the goodness-of-fit.

## Summary


::: {.panel-tabset}

### Modelling Population Exposure to Air Pollution

- When modelling population exposure, accurate prediction of NO~2~ is key. 
- No golden rules for method choice, but for finer temporal intervals, you have to consider small-scale variability even more
- Finer temporal population is helpful (e.g. Daytime/Nighttime Population)

### Understanding the R Ecosystem is important for public use

* Like other computer languages, R Ecosystem changes continuously. 
* Making the best use case is to add the road weight with the **‚Äúbig brothers‚Äù** e.g. `tibble`, `sf`, `dplyr`
